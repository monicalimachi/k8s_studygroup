## SERVICE ACCOUNTS
### User account
So there are two types of accounts in Kubernetes. A user account and a serviceaccount. 
As you might already know, the user account is used by humans. And service accounts are used by machines. 
A user account could be for an administrator accessing the cluster to perform administrative tasks, a developer accessing the cluster to deploy applications etc. 
A service account, could be an account used by an application to interact with the kubernetes cluster. 
For example a monitoring application like Prometheus uses a service account to poll the kubernetes API for performance metrics. 
An automated build tool like Jenkins uses service accounts to deploy applications on the kubernetes cluster.

### Service account
It first creates the service account object
Creates the secret object, linked to service account
```
kubectl describe serviceaccount name_service_account
kubectl describe secret token_from_service_account
kubectl get serviceaccount
```
- Create a service account and us
- Assign the role permissions
- Export your service account tokens
